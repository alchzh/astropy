Fixes loading of tile-compressed integer data with a ``ZBLANK`` header.
The ``ZBLANK`` header is only supported for floating point data and is
now ignored for integer data. If the original data is scaled with
BZERO/BSCALE before compression, the ``BLANK`` header should be used
to indicate NaNs. This change fixes the loading of Pan-STARRS images
restores the behavior of astropy 5.2 and earlier.
